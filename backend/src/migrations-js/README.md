# Database Migrations

This folder contains TypeORM database migrations for the Boetos application.

## Running Migrations

Migrations should run automatically during application startup.

If you need to run them manually:

```bash
npm run typeorm migration:run
```

These migrations are JavaScript files converted from TypeScript sources.
